# MLB Player Unique Identifier Equivalencies
Python Jupyter Notebook that produces a .csv file showing equivalent 2022 MLB player unique identifers for Baseball Reference and RetroSheet

Thank you for showing interest in my work! Currently this is a working draft, in the near future I would like to update this notebook to be more clear and concise.

As it stands currently, I hope this project helps you to understand my thought process and technical skill.

Also, I hope that anyone who needs this infomation (Baseball Reference IDs matched with RetroSheet IDs) is served well by my work as well. 

Happy 2023, Go Giants! <3
