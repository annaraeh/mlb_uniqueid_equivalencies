# MLB Player Unique Identifier Equivalencies
Python Jupyter Notebook that produces a .csv file showing equivalent 2022 MLB player unique identifers for Baseball Reference and RetroSheet

Thank you for showing interest in my work!

The final result is a table (.csv file) that has a row for every 2022 MLB player with their Name, Baseball Reference ID, and RetroSheet ID. https://github.com/annaraeh/mlb_uniqueid_equivalencies/blob/main/2022_MLBUniqueIdentiferEquivalencies_BaseballReferenceRetroSheet.csv

I hope this project helps you to understand my thought process and technical skill, and also helps anyone who needs this information.

Currently this is a working draft, in the near future I would like to update this notebook to be more clear and concise. I would also like to edit the code and directory structure to consoldate the extraneous files and highlight the final product.

Happy 2023, Go Giants! <3
